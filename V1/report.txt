Time to build the containerized pipeline and test it with a local orchestrator: 4:48 hours
    Note: 
        - the logic is not implemented
        - each service is tested with the same dummy file
        - the orchestrator is not containerized yet
    Improvements:
        - containerize the orchestrator and use the shared volume
